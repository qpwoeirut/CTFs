Our favorite protagonist Sloppy Python, was able to sneak into the base of the baddies. Their internal system hosts containts a critical key that needs to be exfiltrated, but all their systems are locked down.

Except for one: An ancient terminal with broken screen and enough ink for a single ls.

Can you help Sloppy Python to steal the key?

In cryptography class we learned about random numbers and algorithms to create pseudo random number generators. I think I build a solid cipher that nobody can break. This is why I call it SecureLongCiphertextGenerator, SLCG for short

You have climbed the mountain and reached the top. You are now in the presences of the glacier spirit which seems to have an affinity for ASCON. But it seems confused about how to use it.

Within the heart of Austria's alpine mystery lies your next conquest. Ascend the highest peak, shrouded in whispers of past explorers, to uncover the flag.txt awaiting atop. Beware the silent guards that stand sentinel along the treacherous path, obstructing your ascent.

At the last halloween party we played some guitar hero, which was a whole lot of fun and helped me to get over my fear of ghosts. Eventually we played through all the songs the game had to offer, so I decided to create one of my own. I also added a Warmup Map called Invincible, so that you can easily shred through the other one. I hope you enjoy it!
