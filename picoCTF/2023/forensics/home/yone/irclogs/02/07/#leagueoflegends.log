[21:25] <yone786> Yes, yes… I know that
[21:25] <yone786> That’s why I asked you
[21:25] <beautifulAkali07> Why don’t you want her to be on your team then?
[21:25] <yone786> Yeah, because
[21:26] <beautifulAkali07> I do want to be on your team.
[21:26] <beautifulAkali07> My team is a very small team at this point.
[21:27] <beautifulAkali07> I want to get on the list.
[21:28] <yone786> I know
[21:29] <beautifulAkali07> Thank you though
[21:30] <yone786> Thank you for your answer
[21:30] <yone786> I didn’t say anything
[21:30] <beautifulAkali07> I know
[21:31] <AdriiB> But can you not see that you are already on the list?
[21:31] <yone786> I can see that my team isn’t a very strong one
[21:32] <beautifulAkali07> I think I will start a new team soon, so I don’t want to add another member.
[21:32] <beautifulAkali07> But yeah.
[21:32] <AdriiB> Then use the next time you get on your team to join this list.
[21:33] <yone786> But she is in. I want. I love. That person.
[21:33] <beautifulAkali07> But yeah, I’m on your team
[21:33] <AdriiB> And I suggest that you do not get distracted by the fact that some other member of your team is already on the list.
[21:33] <beautifulAkali07> I’ve thought about it.
[21:33] <beautifulAkali07> I’m not going to get distracted by the fact that I’m already on your team.
[21:33] <beautifulAkali07> It wouldn’t make any sense to me.
[21:34] <beautifulAkali07> I’m on your team.
[21:34] <AdriiB> What the hell does “make sense” mean?
[21:34] <beautifulAkali07> Sorry
[21:35] <BeautifulAkali07> I didn’t mean it like that.
[21:35] <beautifulAkali07> I’m going to use the word “sense” for one of my teams I created.
[21:35] <beautifulAkali07> I’m going to use it for all of them.
[21:35] <beautifulAkali07> There was a time when there was no sense to it.
[21:35] <yone786> I don’t like. Where are you going
[21:35] <AdriiB> “I don’t like” as in “Oh no, Akali is going to leave me” ?
[21:35] <beautifulAkali07> Yes
[21:35] <AdriiB> Now how do you “like” someone leaving you in a comment?
[21:35] <beautifulAkali07> What do you mean?
[21:35] <yone786> I didn’t say.
[21:35] <beautifulAkali07> I think I might stop by sometime and say hi
[21:36] <beautifulAkali07> See you in a while
[21:36] <yone786> I don’t know
[21:36] <beautifulAkali07> Why don’t you tell me your answer?
[21:36] <beautifulAkali07> OK.
[21:36] <yone786>
