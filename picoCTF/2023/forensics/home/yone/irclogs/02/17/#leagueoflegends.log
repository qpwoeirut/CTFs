[07:01] <yone786> Who’s your favorite hero?
[07:05] <TheUnforgivenYasuo9000> It’s in the name.
[07:05] <TrevorK> It just depends on the situation, the ops, you know?
[07:07] <oneTrueAatrox> I’m a huge fan of Zoe
[07:08] <yone786> lol
[07:09] <yone786> TrevorK: yeah, but if you had to pick one. It’s not about winning, it’s about fun
[07:10] <TheUnforgivenYasuo9000> There’s a reason why she’s a team leader in a game that has only one.
[07:10] <yone786> i’m not trying to get any attention, it’s just my opinion
[07:11] <TREVORK> If you have to choose, who would be your favorite hero for this season?
[07:11] <TrevorK> You know, I think it would be really interesting if we had a new player that joined the roster.
[07:11] <TrevorK> I don’t think that would be fun, I don’t think that would be a good experience for people who were watching in real life.
[07:12] <TrevorK> They just wouldn’t get to know enough.
[07:13] <TrevorK> I wouldn’t want to give the new player any special privileges.
[07:14] <TrevorK> I want them to be completely fresh, so we can see how they would fit in as well.
[07:14] <TrevorK> I just think that it would be interesting.
[07:14] <TREVORK> What type of heroes would you want to play with?
[07:14] <TrevorK> I personally would like to play with Zoe, and maybe someone else, but I’m pretty sure that I would be the first to say that I’m in love with her.
[07:15] <TrevorK> I personally find her really cute
[07:15] <TrevorK> But I think most people would probably agree with me if I’m just speaking for myself.
[07:15] <TrevorK> I like her, and I like to watch her play, so… I want to see her in action. I want to see her get to play in a different game.
[07:16] <TrevorK> That’s all.
[07:16] <g1y-h3ss> I would like to play with Zoe
[07:16] <TrevorK> A new player?
[07:17] <TrevorK> Why not?
