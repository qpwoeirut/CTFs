[21:23] <beautifulAkali07> But to be clear: I’m an indie dev, I want my money
[21:23] <yone786> I’ll happily pay for a song
[21:23] <beautifulAkali07> But I think people need to know there’s no money in this for me
[21:23] <beautifulAkali07> I’ve been trying to get this job, and I’m not even getting interviews
[21:24] <yone786> Oh, because you’ve only been looking?
[21:24] <beautifulAkali07> No
[21:24] <beautifulAkali07> Because I’m trying to get the job on my own
[21:25] <yone786> Oh, I didn’t realize that
[21:25] <AdriiB> Why aren’t you getting interviews?
[21:25] <beautifulAkali07> Because I think they don’t really know how hard it is
[21:25] <yone786> Well, maybe you’ll get a job
[21:25] <beautifulAkali07> They don’t seem to think it’s a big deal
[21:25] <beautifulAkali07> I’ve been applying to things for years
[21:26] <beautifulAkali07> I was rejected about 10 times, with very different causes
[21:26] <beautifulAkali07> I think it’s an important thing to know that they want us and that we could be doing that job
[21:26] <yone786> Ah well, if you don’t get this job, you’ll know what to do next
[21:26] <beautifulAkali07> So I think it’s a good thing to be aware of that
[21:27] <beautifulAkali07> And I don’t think I’m being really arrogant if I just tell you
[21:28] <AdriiB> Yeah I see how you are doing it then
[21:28] <AdriiB> I see.
[21:28] <beautifulAkali07> Because if I don’t get an interview, it doesn’t mean anything
[21:28] <yone786> Well, don’t worry about it then, you can always be like what’s up
[21:29] <yone786> And it’ll be fine
[21:29] <beautifulAkali07> No it won’t
[21:29] <beautifulAkali07> I’ve talked with so many people, so many times, and I know how not to do this
[21:29] <beautifulAkali07> Why? Because I can’t do it, and it’s not very fun or interesting
[21:30] <yone786> Then I wouldn’t
[21:30] <beautifulAkali07> No, and I wish I could but I don’t think that’s what you want too either
[21:30] <beautifulAkali07> This is my first time applying for a job
[21:30] <beautifulAkali07> I don’t have any previous experience with working with computers
[21:30] <yone786> I mean, you’re trying, you’re applying, you should be fine
[21:30] <beautifulAkali07> Why are you doing that? Like I’ve got this job
[21:30] <beautifulAkali07> And there’s nothing I really wanted, I just thought it would help me get a job
[21:30] <AdriiB> I get it, and then you say “well if you don’t get this job, I just thought it would help me get a job”
[21:30] <beautifulAkali07> I don’t have a job where just
