[21:24] <beautifulAkali07> I just don’t like to type on the mac
[21:24] <beautifulAkali07> But when I do it is nice
[21:25] <yone786> I don’t like things to be in word form
[21:25] <AdriiB> I don’t understand your point
[21:25] <beautifulAkali07> You mean that you don’t want to see all the text
[21:25] <yone786> lol
[21:25] <AdriiB> I just don’t want to have to type on the mac
[21:25] <beautifulAkali07> I just don’t like the size of the text
[21:25] <beautifulAkali07> I have a small screen, so maybe that is it
[21:26] <beautifulAkali07> And I am on a mac, so I can see better colors than i have in my PC
[21:27] <beautifulAkali07> I get my text from gmail, and I don’t have to type as much
[21:27] <beautifulAkali07> But I do hate when I type on my laptop
[21:28] <yone786> You can configure which size you get
[21:28] <beautifulAkali07> I am gonna stop by the cafe to get coffee
[21:28] <beautifulAkali07> I guess I will have to just keep a laptop computer in my room.
[21:28] <beautifulAkali07> Goodnight all.
[21:28] <AdriiB> good night xD

[21:31] <beautifulAkali07> Bye
[21:32] <cispercai_n> Hello again
[21:32] <AdriiB> Hi
[21:32] <cispercai_n> I was thinking that I could get a Macbook so that I could try to port Ubuntu to it
[21:32] <cispercai_n> Then I guess I will run it on my Ubuntu netbook
[21:33] <AdriiB> What kind of netbook?
[21:33] <cispercai_n> Not a netbook, but I was thinking that one of the Netbooks at best buy was compatible with Ubuntu
[21:33] <cispercai_n> I think that the screen would be too small
[21:33] <cispercai_n> And my netbook is kind of ancient
[21:34] <cispercai_n> But I have Windows XP in it
[21:34] <AdriiB> What kind of netbook?
[21:34] <cispercai_n> But I would do the research and get as much information as possible about the netbook that I could use
[21:34] <cispercai
