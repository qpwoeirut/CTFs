[07:10] <TrevorK> No, I like my heroes just fine where I’m at.
[07:10] <TrevorK> There’s a lot of fun stuff in the game. That stuff is fun, but I don’t think you can’t appreciate that without winning.
[07:11] <yone786> I can appreciate winning.
[07:12] <oneTrueAatrox> And I’m a realist too, if I win I have to have fun too, so there’s not a lot of meh
[07:14] <TrevorK> For me, the fun stuff is what I like to do.
[07:15] <yone786> yeah, the win is just there to force you to be more focused on the fun stuff
[07:16] <TrevorK> That’s why they have to build the new things, there’s no time for me to make a game, it has to be built to make the new things work.
[07:17] <TrevorK> And I can’t just sit around and hope that my game will be good.
[07:18] <TrevorK> So I have to make it work.
[07:18] <yone786> TrevorK: yeah, like I said, sometimes you can make fun stuff, sometimes not. But it still should have a sense of fun to it, or else you just have to be forced into some “art”
[07:19] <yone786> TrevorK: but yes, that’s the main thing I’m saying. I can appreciate winning and fun stuff, but not at the same time
[07:20] * oersted is away: Gone away for a while
[07:21] <oneTrueAatrox> I can’t afford to win every fight, I have to have fun.
[07:22] <yone786> TrevorK: that’s why I’m not the kind of person who always wins at the end (in most fights), but I can appreciate it. It doesn’t have to be always the case.
[07:23] <oneTrueAatrox> But if I just fight for fun, I won’t ever get good.
[07:24] <TrevorK> No, I like my heroes to have goals and a reason for coming to where I do.
[07:25] <TrevorK> If I just go and try to win, I will lose.
[07:26] <yone786> haha
[07:26] <TrevorK> So I have to have fun, or else I can’t be there.
[07:26] <TrevorK> And it’s not like it’s fun to me losing.
[07:27] <TrevorK> It’s fun to me winning.
[07:28] * oersted is back (gone for 30 minutes)
[07:28] <TrevorK> We build the game to satisfy a certain type of person.
[07:29] <TrevorK> I don’t know what that type of person is, but they are not me.
[07:29] <TrevorK> And I am that type of person.
[07:29] <TrevorK> So that’s why it’s a fun game to me.
[07:30] <TrevorK> Because I can appreciate it.
[07:30] <TrevorK> But I am not that type of person.
[07:30] <TrevorK> Just because I get to know I’m that person doesn’t mean I have
