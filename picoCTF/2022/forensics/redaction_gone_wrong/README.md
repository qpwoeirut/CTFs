Now you DONâ€™T see me.<br>
This [report](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/264/Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf) has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not. Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

Open the PDF in a file viewer and select all the contents with your cursor.
Then copy-paste it somewhere else and look for the flag within that text.
