A message has come in but it seems to be all scrambled. Luckily it seems to have the key at the beginning. Can you crack this substitution cipher?<br>

A second message has come in the mail, and it seems almost identical to the first one. Maybe the same thing will work again.<br>

Some letters only show up once (such as Q/J), so make sure to check if the decryption makes sense and no characters are swapped.

It seems that another encrypted message has been intercepted. The encryptor seems to have learned their lesson though and now there isn't any punctuation! Can you still crack the cipher?
