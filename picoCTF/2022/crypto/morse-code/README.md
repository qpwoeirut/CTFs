> **Description**<br>
Morse code is well known. Can you decrypt this?<br>
Download the file [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/235/morse_chal.wav). <br>
Wrap your answer with picoCTF{}, put underscores in place of pauses, and use all lowercase.

Transcribe the recording manually into morse code.
It may be helpful to look at the waveform in an app such as Audacity.
Then use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Morse_Code('Space','Line%20feed')Find_/_Replace(%7B'option':'Regex','string':'%20'%7D,'_',true,false,true,false)&input=Li0tIC4uLi4gLi4uLi0gLS0uLi4KLi4uLiAuLi4uLSAtLS4uLiAuLi4uCi0tLS0uIC0tLS0tIC0uLgouLS0gLi4tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi4tIC0tLS0uIC4uLi4gLS0uLi4) to decode it.
