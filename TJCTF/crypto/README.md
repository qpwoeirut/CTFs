`n` can be factored with [factordb](http://factordb.com/index.php?query=1216177716507739302616478655910148392804849).
From there, the two ciphertexts can be decrypted with standard RSA procedure to find the flag.

We know the first 6 characters of the flag should be `tjctf{`.
The description mentions the keyboard, and we can see that the provided text's characters are all one key offset from what we expect.
To find the flag, we offset in the other direction.

We're given three challenges to factor RSA moduli.
The first challenge has p < 2<sup>44</sup> and can be solved with Pollard-Rho.
The second has `p` and `q` close together and can be solved with Fermat's Factorization.
The third has a smooth `p-1` and can be solved with Pollard's p-1 algorithm.

I originally implemented these algorithms in Python, but they were too slow since I was using an inefficient version of the p-1 algorithm.
I spent a while trying to optimize things before giving up and rewriting it in C++ with GMP with a Python program to facilitate communication with the server.

This is an implementation of the [Paillier cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paillier_cryptosystem), which is the first result from searching "Pascal cryptosystem".
We need to encrypt a constant message `m` given the encryption of `4` without knowing the entire public key.

The Wikipedia article mentions that this system allows for homomorphic addition and multiplication of plaintexts.
In particular, raising a ciphertext to a constant `k` will create a ciphertext whose decryption is `k` times the original plaintext mod `n`.
We can set `k = 4^-1 * m` to get the flag.

I won't lie; I have no clue how MÃ¶bius transformations work.
But I did enough reading on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation#Formula_for_the_inverse_transformation) and [StackOverflow](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3807648/deriving-a-m%C3%B6bius-transformation-specified-by-three-points) to figure out how to recover the image of a fourth point, given preimage-image pairs of three points.
The implementation of the method described is fairly straightforward.
The only issue I had was with floating-point precision, and I got around that with `gmpy2`.
