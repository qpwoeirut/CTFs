`n` can be factored with [factordb](http://factordb.com/index.php?query=1216177716507739302616478655910148392804849).
From there, the two ciphertexts can be decrypted with standard RSA procedure to find the flag.

We know the first 6 characters of the flag should be `tjctf{`.
The description mentions the keyboard, and we can see that the provided text's characters are all one key offset from what we expect.
To find the flag, we offset in the other direction.

Python and SymPy too slow, used C++ GMP

I won't lie; I have no clue how MÃ¶bius transformations work.
But I did enough reading on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation#Formula_for_the_inverse_transformation) and [StackOverflow](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3807648/deriving-a-m%C3%B6bius-transformation-specified-by-three-points) to figure out how to recover the image of a fourth point, given preimage-image pairs of three points.
The implementation of the method described is fairly straightforward.
The only issue I had was with floating-point precision, and I got around that with `gmpy2`.
