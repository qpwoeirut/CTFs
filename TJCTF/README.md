This was my first CTF in quite a while, and it was a good reminder of how fun CTFs can be.
I played solo and finished 32<sup>nd</sup> overall and 7<sup>th</sup> in high school.

All my solutions are detailed in the category-specific READMEs.
The other files are a conglomeration of challenge files and solve scripts.
